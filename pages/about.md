**Welcome to my unofficial love letter to the branding of the clothing company Lazy Oaf in relation to the use of typography. Long have I been enamoured with the many conflicting elements of the brand’s aesthetic and how they work together to perfectly represent its identity. The identity of the Lazy Oaf brand is something I have always connected with- self described as having a sense of “teen rebellion” and “warped sense of humour” which are two things I can certainly relate to. From their use of colours to their individual garments, Lazy Oaf are a very unique brand whose marque is firmly rooted in how they present themselves. I would confidently argue that the typography used on Lazy Oaf products is one of their key identifiers- so iconic that it is easily recognisable whether it be on a stranger in public or Noel Fielding on The Great British Bake Off. I intend to go into much more detail on these key aspects of Lazy Oaf’s branding in various blog posts.**
