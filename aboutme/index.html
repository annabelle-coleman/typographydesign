<h2>About Me</h2>

<h3><u>Where Am I From?</u></h3>
<p>Although I’m currently living in Oxford for university, originally I’m from Leicestershire. I grew up in a rural village so I do miss being closer to nature sometimes when I'm in the city. I never realise how quiet and peaceful it is at home until I go back.</p>

<h3><u>Favourie Pastimes</u></h3>
<p>An initial bit of information about me is the things I like to do in my spare time. I love reading, writing and going on walks to find flowers to press.</p>

<h3><u>The Last Book I Read</u></h3>

<h3><u>Current Hobby</u></h3>
<p>Given the current state of everything, my current indoor hobby is learning how to be a plant mother and I’m managing to sustain 5 healthy plants! Hopefully I can keep it that way as I do have a tendency to forget to water them.</p>

<h3><u>What Do I Want to Do in the Future?</u></h3>
<p>I would like to work in book publishing in the future because I love books and reading so much that I would love to have a hand in the process of creating them, I’m especially passionate about keeping physical copies of books alive rather than e-books.</p>
